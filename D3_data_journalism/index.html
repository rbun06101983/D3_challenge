          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Examining the data collected from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates, we could analyze a variety of different analyses about health risk.
            In the chart above, a comparison was made between poverty and healthcare. As one could see, the states with the higher percentage of 
            poverty also will have the higher percentage of those who lack healthcare. There could be other factors that contribute to this
            correlation but the chart shows good evidence regarding the correlation bewtween poverty and healthcare. </p>

          <p>Hovering over each point will correspond to a state that will show the exact percentage of the poulation that are in poverty and lacks healthcare</p>

          <p>Other data could give many insights. Other correlations that could be made are between poverty, healthcare, age, household income, obesity, etc.</p>
